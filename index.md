# Spotify Blog

Welcome to the blog. Here I will write my notes and comments regarding the music on my Spotify account. 

## Mix Reference
My [mix reference playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4WBlc9EoxXQytBFPtBShP5?si=9b498a11573d49a7) was created for purposes such as speaker system tuning, mix reference, headphone and speaker testing, and others. It is constantly updated with a wide variety of various genres of music. I have categorized some particular tracks which are of note.
